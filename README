If you've ever run sysbench, you know it's impossible to reasonably compare
more than 2 tests at once.  Beyond that, you *need* graphs.  Seems like
everyone has their own home-grown set of little scripts to parse sysbench's
output and turn it into a CSV or something else.  This is my attempt at it.
I tried various existing things but none of them satisfied me.

HOWTO USE
=========

When you use sysbench, you're typically trying to find which configuration
works best among a set of different configs.  A "configuration" could be a
certain type of HDD vs another one, a filesystem vs another one, etc.  For
a given configuration, you typically run a range of tests, with different
parameters (e.g. different number of concurrent threads and whatnot). This
script simply wants you to put the output of all the tests you ran for a
given configuration into one directory.  Look at the sample script included
in this repository, runtests.sh, for an example.

So using the example included in this repository:
  mkdir ~/out
  cd ~/out
  ~/runtests.sh
  ~/sysbench-log2json.py */*

Now you should have a big `results.js', which you need to put in the same
directory as `sysbench.html'.  Open the HTML file and enjoy pretty graphs.
